TO DO
        -Implement more efficient method of calculating approximation
        -Test to find optimal number of iterations for solver
        -Determine best way to normalize output for loss scaling (maybe 1+normalize_current)
        -Adapt to work with tensorflow
        -To increase memory efficency instead of saving all fields, have current field max currents and current currents saved,
         update the max currents looking for new max's after each itteration, this reduces memory from K*gt size to 4*gt size
